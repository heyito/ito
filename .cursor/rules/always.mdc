## Development cycle

1. Before writing any code, come up with an extremely good plan, review the plan, and then ask the user for permission to execute the plan.
2. Always rely on the user for manually testing
3. Always use bun as your preferred package manager.
4. Always rely on the user to install new packages / update new packages
5. Prefer code that is easy to read and self-documenting. Use comments sparingly.
6. Never use empty catch statements.
